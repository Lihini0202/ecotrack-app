# Contribution Guidelines

## 🌱 Branching Strategy
- Branch only from `lihini`.
- Use feature-based branches: `feat/<feature-name>` or `fix/<bug-name>`.

## 📝 Commit Style (Conventional Commits)
Use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard:
- `feat: add goal tracker`
- `fix: correct quiz bug`
- `docs: update README`
- `chore: configure deployment`
- `test: add habit tracker tests`

## 🔍 Pull Request Rules
- All pull requests require **code review** before merging.
- Keep pull requests **small**, focused, and atomic.
- Link related issues in the PR description (e.g., `Fixes #23`).
- All new features must include **tests**.

## 🕒 SLA (Issue Response Guidelines)
All issues must be labeled with priority levels:
| Label | Description | SLA |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| `P1 - Critical` | Urgent: blocking app | Resolve within 24 hours |
| `P2 - High` | Important but not blocking | Resolve within 3 days |
| `P3 - Medium` | Normal priority feature/bug | Resolve within 7 days |
| `P4 - Low` | Minor issue or enhancement | As time permits |

Please assign the correct priority label when opening an issue.
