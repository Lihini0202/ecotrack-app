# SLA Monitoring for EcoTrack App

This SLA defines how quickly issues will be responded to and resolved based on priority level.

| Priority | Label Name       | Response Time             | Resolution Time          |
|----------|------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| P1       | P1 - Critical     | Within 1 business hour     | Within 24 hours          |
| P2       | P2 - High         | Within 1 business day      | Within 3 business days   |
| P3       | P3 - Medium       | Within 2 business days     | Within 7 business days   |
| P4       | P4 - Low          | Within 3 business days     | As time permits          |

##  SLA Monitoring Practice

- Every issue is labeled with a priority (P1 to P4).
- We check open issues weekly for resolution status.
- PRs linked to P1 or P2 issues must include reference in title/description.

## Tools

- Labels used on GitHub
- Manual checks via project board or Issues tab

---

> SLA rules are reviewed monthly and adjusted based on team performance and capacity.
