###  What is the feature?
I want to add a "Daily Streak" system where users are rewarded for completing eco-friendly tasks multiple days in a row. It could include badges, motivational quotes, or bonus points.

###  Why is this feature useful?
This will boost user motivation, retention, and encourage consistent eco-friendly behavior â€” perfect for our app's goals.

###  Additional context
Apps like Duolingo and Habitica use streak-based reward systems to keep users engaged. We could add small animations and a badge in the profile section.
